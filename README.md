# create-react-express
Starter Pack for React and Express (Full Stack Development)

> Heavily inspired by [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy/react_express_starter), with small changes and up-to-date libraries and methods

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```

## Additional Information

Use dotenv in a environment.env file for safe deployment, never push this file to git.  
Install [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) package
```
npm install dotenv
```  

Use express-session for simple session middleware usage for Express.  
Great for cookies and sessions.
Install [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session) package
```
npm install express-session
```
